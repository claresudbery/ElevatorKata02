# ElevatorKata01
elevator kata - second attempt 

I strongly suspect this one is a crazy way of doing things, but I'm trying it anyway as a kind of intellectual* exercise.
*self-indulgent

The kata itself (see http://blog.milesburton.com/2013/03/28/elevator-kata-mind-bending-pairing-exercise/):

- An elevator responds to calls containing a source floor and direction
- An elevator delivers passengers to requested floors
- Elevator calls are queued not necessarily FIFO
- You may validate passenger floor requests
- you may implement current floor monitor
- you may implement direction arrow
- you may implement doors (opening and closing)
- you may implement DING!
- there can be more than one elevator
- ?? Max number of lift occupants?
